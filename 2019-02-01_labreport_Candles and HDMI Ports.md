# Candles and HDMI Ports

I bolted up the stairs of Holmes expecting to burst in late to class to find my classmates standing outside of the room. "That's kind of odd," I thought to myself as I tried to gather my breath. I overheard some people talking about aprons? Were we going to get messy? After a few minutes a women wearing a jacket with the Boston Fire Department logo walked in, and we seemed ready to get started. We walked into the room, dimly lit by candles. A piece of paper and an old letter were placed in front of every seat. As soon as Professor Cordell said, "Start copying," there was a small buzz of unanswered questions. 

"_Do I have to make my handwriting look like the author's?_" 

"_What if I can't read it?_" 

"_...The whole thing_?"

"_How long do I have?_"

As I began copying the letter in front of me, I grew irritated quite quickly. The shadows of the light kept getting in my way, no matter how I turned my paper. I was so focused on making my handwriting look like the author's mangled cursive that I realized half-way through that I had no idea what words I was actually writing. I kept hearing papers turning and thinking "Wow, people are already half-way done?" My hand was cramped, and straining my eyes gave me a massive headache. Time felt ...so...incredibly...slow. 

When we exchanged pages in class, it was surprised to see how far other people had gotten. Their copied texts were far easier for me to read than the original, which I don't think is something that could be said about mine. It was interesting to see the assumptions they had made about the illegible words of the text, especially when I disagreed with them. It almost felt like half the class wished that they were working in Word, with the ability to spellcheck and backspace as they pleased, while the other half wished they were working in Illustrator, to be able to trace over the words and push and pull them as they pleased. 

It's interesting to think about what scribes of the scriptorium had to prioritize. Was it their responsibility to simply copy the text as closely as possible, or to interpret the illegible parts, to create meaning when they couldn't identify it? I think the latter is what Ã†lfric fears, particularly when he says, 

> "...I have no control if someone brings it to error through lesser scribes, and it is then his peril, not mine. The bad scribe does much evil if he will not correct his errors."
 
Originally, when I thought about the work of a scribe, I was struck by its permanence, the way that the words scratched onto vellum lasted for hundreds of years. After this lab, I'm struck by its fluidity, the way that its meaning is so dependent on who is copying the text and their time and place in society.

This semester, I'm taking a class called Special Effects in Post-Production for TV. We discuss how different special effects in famous television shows were created, and how those programs use Adobe softwares, like After Effects, PhotoShop, and Illustrator. 

Our most recent assignment was to create a short, 20 second, lyric video to a song. Working on my small MacBook Air for these assignments can be hard, but so can finding an open big computer in Snell. My quick solution to this problem was to connect my MacBook Air to the television in the apartment. I grabbed my roommates HDMI cord, took a seat on our living room floor, and quickly realized that my laptop didn't have an HDMI port. I ordered an HDMI converter for my computer at the start of the semester, and I've been using it to complete assignments for this class and to just watch content I would typically stream to my computer on a larger scale. 

Though I recognize that a DisplayPort to HDMI converter isn't _as_ intrinsic to my work as a candle is to a scribe, both objects serve a similar function in that they expand the contexts in which people can work (I can now work on larger, television screens in spaces off campus, and a scribe can now work beyond the hours of sunlight). The DisplayPort to HDMI converter is a reflection the ways in which people use media today. Most forms of digital creation are accessible, or even made better, through the usage of multiple technologies. 

It's interesting to see the ways in which social trends can impact the media we use. I bought this MacBook Air at the start of college simply because it just seemed to be what most people had. Had I bought a different computer, perhaps I wouldn't have even needed to order this DisplayPort to HDMI converter, which is unique to Macbooks. I also think that it is important to recognize that I am fortunate enough to be able to purchase something like a Macbook. I can't help but wonder if the need for this DisplayPort to HDMI converter is almost a form of technological elitism. It creates a barrier to using multiple technologies that can really only be overcome by money.
