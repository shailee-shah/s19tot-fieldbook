##Analysis

When I first arrived in the special archives section of the Northeastern library, I thought I was running late. I rushed in towards the closest chair with all my belongings to quickly be told to put everything against the wall. I was struck by how the special archives section was kind of exactly how I imagined it to be. Very clean and organized, but it still felt a little bit unused, despite the research being conducted there. 

###The Dragon Prayer Book
The book that I had taken a seat in front of looked beautiful and ridiculous. It was smaller than my hand, yet it was thicker than any textbook I had ever seen. It looked old...like really, really old, and despite being so thick, it seemed incredibly fragile. Though it was designed in its shape to allow for portability, it seemed the furthest thing from portable to me. I initially thought that I needed to use gloves to handle it. The edges of the pages were jagged, and several had a small tab to be used as a bookmark to flip to the prayers you would read more often. This book was handwritten. Because the text was handwritten, the margin lines were used to guide the scribe's handwriting. This book was written on animal skin, which we learned was called _vellum_; you could see the pores one side of the page. The writing was incredibly uniform, and certain section of red and blue ink puncuated the blocky, black text. There were also music notes on the pages because these prayers were meant to be sung.

Because this book was handwritten and printed on animal skin, we can gather that it must have been incredibly expensive, reserved for those in the upper class or more likely in this case involved with the church. I think that this prayer book is unique because often, illuminated manuscripts were meant to be seen more than they were meant to be read (much like the _Book of Kells_ that Borsuk mentions); however, given the compact size of _The Dragon Prayer Book_, it seems like it was meant to be carried around and read. One person probably owned this book, and I wonder whether they had the prayers memorized or relied of the book to be able to share them. Did the book act as a status symbol, a useful tool, or both?

###Ovidii Nasonis Amatoria

The second book looked much more like any other hard cover book I would see today. Because this book was printed on rag paper, I could see the chain lines in the pages. This book was printed using a printing press, so all the text was black and very uniform. Despite being printed, the margin lines that would guide a scribes writing still remained. Though there was no color in this book, some of the letters were printed to look like the drawings done in the _The Dragon Prayer Book_ This book had numbered pages, so that those putting together the book could understand how it all fit together. 

Because this book was printed on rag paper and lacked the ornate detailing of the first one, I would guess that is was accessible to a wider group of people. The printing press allowed for an expansion of the audience of the book, which must have led to more people not only being able to read, but also relying on the book as a source of information about their religion. 

###The Gutenberg Bible

The Gutenberg Bible was the book I chose to look at online. This book is available in both vellum and in paper (I'm not too sure what kind of paper, this is how the website distinguishes between the two). I thought it was interesting how the paper version is full of incredibly ornate and colorful drawings, while the vellum copy is a little bit more plain, despite probably containing the more expensive pages. Because this book is from around the same time as the printing press was created, that makes me think that the text was printed and the drawing and detaiing were added after by hand.

This book seemed like it would be a bit bigger than the two that I saw in the Special Archives section. This makes me think that it probably sat somewhere, whether that be in the church or in the home of someone wealthy, and was looked at during special occasions. 

After reading the website for some context, _The Gutenberg Bible_ refers to th bibles which Gutenberg printed in order to popoularize his new technology, the printing press. The printing press allowed books to become more accessible, but only if they came hand in hand with cheaper paper (not vellum).

##Conclusion

#####"The shape and style of these early manuscripts reflect the reading practices of their day ad they needs they were designed to meet" - Amaranth Borsuk

These three texts all came to be at an important time in the history of the book, the birth of the printing press. When analyzing these books, it becomes a little bit more evident the ways in which societies treated information, and how the printing press altered that treatment. 

The pre and post printing press eras see a shift in the ways in which people read as well. We learned in the Borsuk reading that pre-printing press, reading was a community-driven activity; you would either read to others or others would read to you. Perhaps this is why _The Dragon Prayer Book_ has this air of importance that surrounds it. The way that it's bound and detailed makes it seem like a thing of privelege to be able to understand. Post-printing press era allowed for reading to become more private. Slowly but surely, the increased accessibility of books lead to an increase in literacy, but that's not to say that the beauty of the handwritten book was forgotten. As seen in _Ovidii Nasonis Amatoria_ and _The Gutenberg Bible_, many features remain, such as margin lines and ornate artwork.
