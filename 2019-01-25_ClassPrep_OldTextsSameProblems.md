##Old Texts Same Problems

As I was reading the texts for this week, I kept being reminded of one of the themes of last week's discussion: the cyclical nature of history. When discussing the Remem technology, we came to the conclusion that regardless of whether it's a video, or a book, there will always be a bias in interpretation. It seems that people have always kind of known this. In _AElfric's Preface to Genesis: A Translation_, AElfric is reluctant to translate the books of God because he fears that he can't escape imposing his own spiritual understanding of the book into his translation. This can be seen when he says, "We should turn our wills to his [god's] laws and we may not turn his laws into our desires." AElfric is aware of his bias, and recognizes that because of the inherent cultural biases ingrained into language, it's difficult to neutrally translate something. 

I couldn't really make much sense of _Chaucer's words to his Scrivener_, so while taking my notes, I tried to translate the whole poem(?) line by line. This is what I came up with:

	Adam Scrivener, if something bad were ever to happen to you
	Boece or Troilus would have to write it again
	Under your long hair, you might have the scall (some sort of disease?)
	But only after you write more of what I ask
	So often I need to review your work
	It's barely passable 
	All because of your carelessness and ruthless need for control and power. 

As I was trying to translate this, I switched back and forth between looking at the individual words and the entire meaning and syntax of the sentences I was writing, kind of like AElfric did when translating the Book of Genesis ("we dare not write any more in England than that Latin has, nor to change the order, except solely when Latin and English do not have one means of ordering speech"). However, the last sentence especially, uses some strong words. I'm almost positive that because of my modern understanding of English, what I translated is either entirely incorrect or not conveyed in the right tone.
