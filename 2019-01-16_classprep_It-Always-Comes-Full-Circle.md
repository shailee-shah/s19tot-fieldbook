##It Always Comes Full Circle?

Before reading Bonnie Mak's *Architecture of the Page*, I headed over to our class website to review the expectations for a class preperation field book entry. "One to two paragraphs... that's about a single page double spaced? Maybe a little bit longer?" I thought to myself as a I opened up MacDown. Within reading the first paragraph I realized the irony of my thought process. I'd grown so accustomed to the standard letter sized paper, that my immediate reaction was to organize my thoughts accordingly. I've never really though about the implications of the classic 8.5 by 11in page and how it shaped and continues to shape my thought process.

Obviously, with the MacDown set up, this thought process doesn't exactly work. Much like the way that Mak describes the scroll, this interface isn't really "physically circumscribed". Neither are most of the texts we view online. Take news websites for example. The most eyecatching and current information is located on the top and information that's deemed less pertinent is something that we have to scroll from. I wonder if the word scroll is similar to the desktop on a computer. In class, we talked about skeuomorphs mostly in reference to graphical design elements. How closely the verb scroll is tied to the physical object of a scroll? This led me to think about the language that we use to talk about the internet. In class last week, we discussed with our reading of McLuhan how every new media is essentially a remediation of an already existing media. In this weeks text, Mak discusses paginae as a part of a scroll. These paginae defined where different parts of the texts started and stopped, and as you would unfold the scroll to uncover new paginae you would fold up. The internet and the way that we scroll on different web pages seems to me a remediation of the original scroll. I wonder whether that was a thought that someone had in the development of web pages, or whether that was a coincidence as we moved through and between the scroll, the book, and the web page. It's strange to think about whether we've come full circle or whether we've really ever fundamentally changed at all.
