##Class Prep: The Book

One of the most thought-provoking parts of this week's reading was

> "We should keep in mind that no text exists outside of the physical support that offers it for reading (or hearing) or outside of the circumstance in which it was read (or heard). Authors do not write books: they write texts that become written objects-- manuscripts, inscriptions, print matter or, today, material in a computer file." -- Guglielmo Cavallo and Roger Chartier

For me, this quote perfectly summed up the significance of this course. Authors do not write books; authors simply write stories. This chapter in _The Book_ analyzes the ways in which the physical form of the book has changed through time, discussing ancient libraries and scribes. In thinking about the different ways that the book has been adapted over time, I found it impossible not to consider the way that storytelling has changed over time. 

Borsuk mentions "the movement from orality to literacy," and its "central role in the further development of writing to produce literature and foster a necessary audience". It's interesting how she states this at the introducion of __The Alphabet__, as I oringinally believed that objects and ideas would be understood by more if associated with an actor or storyteller, not through a language. I thought this because language isn't universal; however I needed to reconsider the context I was thinking in. Stories haven't always had the global reach that they can have today. I think it's interesting to see many books being adapted for film and television, as it kind of shows that the theme of last week, that every new medium is a remediation of an old medium carries over into this week. I wonder if we would have seen the transition from stage plays and oral storytelling to film and television with out the book.
