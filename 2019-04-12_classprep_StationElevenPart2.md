# Class Prep: Station Eleven - Part 2

This section of the reading came at a very opportune time as the end of every semester always fills me with a lot of existential, what is the point, what am I doing with my life crises. The passage in which Clarke is talking to Dahlia was really impactful I think. It starts by talking about whether you can change people or only change their behavior, which instantly had me questioning what it means to become a better person and kind of the level of predetermination in our lives. I much prefer the belief that our morality is the product of our environment because it seems more flexible, like over time as our environment changes we can change (perhaps see the strengths and errors of our ways).

The thought of being unaware of our own happiness is really interesting to me, and I think it parallels a lot of what Kirstin is struggling with in the future. She often talks about how its better that she does not remember life pre-flu, because she doesn't have to acutely be awaure of all that she's lost. At the same time, she finds such a refuge in the past, in the short term and long term. It just kind of makes me wonder how we know happiness, and whether we only know it terms of loss. Dahlia talks about her boss, Dan, being a ghost. Sleepwalking through the world, but unaware that he is doing this. I just don't know if you can be unhappy without being congnizant of it. What do our feelings mean if we can't label them?
