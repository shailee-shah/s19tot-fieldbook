# Books to TV

The parallels between the moral panic surrounding the first novels and television today are obvious and uncanny. It seems that with every creative breakthrough or new form of expression, there is a horde of critics that laments about its disasterous effects on the minds of young people. I was struck by how similar the Wertner critiques were to the _13 Reasons Why_ critques. Today's binge-watching was yesterday's rapid novel-consuption. I grew up listening to my parents brag to other parents about my reading habits, while other parents complained about their children's television viewing habits. It's odd to think that all of human culture really has just become a cycle of getting comfortable and then something disrupting that comfort over and over again. 

I think that the disposition to regard what is "printed in books as certainly correct" is on that still holds true today. The information that is contained in books is often viewed as static and unchanging. Growing up no one ever told me to fact check the encyclopedias in the library; however, I was always told to never trust wikipedia because anyone could change it. No one really policed the kind of books I read, but my parents were very aware of the movies and television that I watched. Today, books almost have this old school morality about them. Because of their tradition and permanence, it seems like we're less likely to take issue with what is written inside of them, even though there was a time when we worried about them in the same way that we do television and film.
