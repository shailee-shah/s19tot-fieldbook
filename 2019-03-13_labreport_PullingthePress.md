# Lab 6: Part 3 - Pulling the Press

##The Passion of the Press

__“She laughed and laughed and laughed until the vowels were rolling across the walls and floors, as if they meant to do away with the laws of time and space.”__ -- Fredrik Backman

Above is the quote that my partner and I worked on composing to print. I suppose it's somewhat fitting that we accidentally printed a letter o upside down!

After physically working with the historical technology of the printing press, I kind of feel like I understand why the pressmen drank. I was able to enjoy the experience because for me it was novel and I was excited to have this artifact that had my favorite quote printed on it. I can't imagine going through the motions of composing and printing every single day without caring about what you were printing. The view, that the work you do should bring you joy or pride, is one that may be considered aggressively millenial. I don't know if that's necessarily a bad thing as each of my interpretations of the past are clouded by my participation in the present. It struck me during class that Benjamin Franklin would be out of the ordinary for reading some of the texts that he was working to print. 

## Seperation of the Printed Materials and Pressmen

Through this lab, I think I was able to better understand the physicality of creating a book via handpress. When talking about the machinery, it's easy to dismiss it as easier than scribing; however actually utilizing the machinery allows us to see that despite not copying everything down exactly by hand, there is still a level of tediousness.

Thinking back on our visit to the library, I remember being in awe of the handwritten texts. Their intricacies were beautiful, and the time that went into creating them was obvious. It seemed so clear that the creator of the physical text must have developed a close relationship with its meaning. Thinking about the old, press books we look at in class, the amount of effort and energy that went into composing the text for each page seemed far less evident. Perhaps it is because I take the printed book forgranted as it seems so commonplace in my life. 

The act of copying books was once something that felt intensely personal. With the creation of the handpress, it becomes mechanical. When reading Franklin's biography, it becomes clear that the culture of the printhouse isn't one that particularly values the texts that they are printing. Printhouse culture is more about a community of workers doing what they need to do to make a living. 
 
## The Press: Today and Yesterday
Through our discussion of historical means of production, I've frequently thought about the conventions of publishing and how they have changed depending on whatever the current medium of printing is. When thinking about journalism today, it is rare for a journalist to work at a publication that would not on a fundamental level support their views. When thinking about pressmen and the way that we have discussed them in class thus far, it's hard to imagine they cared deeply about the content of the materials they were producing.

Today, a single journalist can be responsible for both the writing and mass distribution of their work through the utilization of Twitter or their own website. Through this lab, the old divisions between writing and mass production become very clear and are further emphasized through our reading of Franklin's biography. Franklin finds it odd when the owner of a printshop composes his type for poems without writing it down elsewhere. The notion of self-publishing, which I would consider relatively commonplace today, is considered odd in the era of the printing press. Unlike twitter (and the internet), printing presses obviously weren't at the general public's finger tips. I can't help but wonder whether or not those operating the printing press new that they were essentially the gateway to information for so many people.
