##Exploring Markdown

As the token, technologically-challenged Humanities major in my friend group, I was excited to tell my more computer-minded friends that I was using GitHub and Markdown in my English class. From my outside perspective, both of these things seemed like such buzzwords to me, and not going to lie, I felt like I was now entering their world of fancy _technologically savvy_. When they saw me with Markdown and Github open on my screen, the conversation went essentially like this: 

What are you doing on MacDown?  
Just typing up an assignment for class 


Why don't you just using Word or Google Docs?  
Uhhhh, I guess my professor wants me to use something I'm not super comfortable with, so I have to think about how it affects my writing...something like that

Do you even know how to use it?  
Well, I can __bold__,I can _italicize_ and I can

- Make
- Some
- Lists

so there are definitely some things I know how to do, thank you very much!

The central claim of McLuhan's piece as we discussed in class was the idea that the vehicle through which text is delivered sends a message about the text itself. As I have been working on typing this lab report, I've noticed that this is true not only for the consumer of the text, but also the creator.

I didn't realize what an obvious example writing in Markdown would be of this, until I sat in Snell to try and write up this lab report. Because my friends were so intrigued, almost distracted by, the medium I was typing in, they didn't really stop to ask about what I was actually writing, which I found to be kind of ironic, as the medium essentially became the whole message. I also think that this can raise some important questions about the ways in which we learn about "new" media. Can deviating from the "norm" in textual representation create a distraction from the message we are sending?  

Traditionally, when writing an academic paper, particularly in college humanities courses, we follow a specific and somewhat standard format:

- 8.5x11in pages
- Size 12 font
- Times New Roman font
- Double-spaced
- A required page length or word count

In Markdown, we lose a lot of the stylistic commands to make that happen. At first, the somewhat limited stylistic interface seemed like it would allow me to just get my thoughts onto paper, without interrupting them with page breaks and mouse clicks; however, as I've been typing, I've noticed that I keep breaking my train of thought to look over at the right side of the screen to make sure everything look exactly as I want it to. When re-reading my sentences to check my grammar and spelling, I've found that it's much more difficult to catch my mistakes on the raw left side of the MacDown screen than the more traditional looking right. Perhaps, this is because the right side of the screen is formatted in a way that I've always associated as traditionally academic.

I've found myself slipping into a more and more casual tone and having to go back and edit myself. I've grown so accustomed to the little, red line that appears when you mispell things in Google Docs and Microsoft Word that without it, it kind of feels like I'm not being edited. I almost revert to the type of language I use when I text my friends. I think that because in Markdown, there isn't really a way to mess up, especially while looking at the left hand of your screen, I slip into interpreting that this assignment as more relaxed than it actually is.

When I went back to re-read my original, stream of conciousness thoughts on the right-hand screen, it became glaringly apparent how ridiculous I sounded. I'd taken the liberty to ignore any and all grammatic conventions, and I hadn't really formatted anything at all. When I went back to reshape and reword my piece, McLuhan's central thesis became a bit more clear to me. Regardless of whether I typed in an extremely casual tone, or a more academic one, my message retained the same inherent meaning. Despite this, how the message will be interperated can be manipulated through through the media which it is presented in.
