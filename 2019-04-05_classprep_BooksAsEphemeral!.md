#Books are Ephemeral?

The book as impermanent (as discusses in _The Book as Idea_ )is an idea that I always wrestle with. On some level, it makes sense to me. Every material object is at a fundamental level impermanent. Over time, we lose things and they fade away, and that is just a fundamental fact of life. However, a book seems so much more than physical to me. It isn't just a vessel of ideas -- we've spent so much time this semester discussing how the form of the book shapes both the ideas within it and the way in which we interact with those ideas. It seems strange that the information someone gleans from a book can live on in memory past the physical expiration date of the book. 

Everytime I read a section from Borsuk, I can't help but think about what a book is. We've gotten quite liberal with our definition of a book, which I think has been helpful in understranding the evolution of ideas through the medium of the book. There was a quote in this section that read:

>"The book, in its purest form, is a phenomenon of space and time and dimensionality that is unique unto itself. When we turn the page, the previous page passes into our past and we are confronted by a new world" -- Dick Higgins, A Book"

This quote stood out to me because in the same breath that it removes the standard conventions of a book, it brings them back with reference to their pages. This really highlights I think the central tension of this class for me. It's a constant push and pull between conventional notions of the book, and expanding its definition as time changes.
