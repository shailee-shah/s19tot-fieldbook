# Twitter and the Telegraph

It's difficult not to compare and contrast the birth of the telegraph in the newsplace to the birth of the internet in the newsplace. The part in Gleick that I found interesting was his description of the acceptance of the telegraph in news media. The idea that editors were able to make any bit of news seem more urgent and more thrilling merely with a small "dispatched by telegraph" label really stuck me. It made me think about the ways in which journalists use Twitter as an information source today.

This may be an incorrect speculation, but with the telegraph, it doesn't particularly seem like there was a strong notion of fact-checking. Gleick mentions that there were some journalists speculating that information "hastily gathered" may not be as reputable as information that "starts later and travels slower". At the same time, the instantaneous transmission of information, might have allowed for a mitigation of the propagation of human error or bias. Information that took less time to reach its final destination had less time to be switched around due to errors in transcription. This is both similar and different to the ways in which journalists use Twitter today. It's not uncommon for new articles assessing the general public's opinion on a particular issue to use tweets to demonstrate their points. It's also not entirely unheard of for whole news stories to begin on Twitter. However, the way that Twitter as a source is viewed differs widely from the way the telegraph was viewed. There seems to be a certain level of fact-checking that a journalist must do before/after using Twitter. This may slow down the process of news reporting which kind of speaks to the idea that hastily gathered news is more likely to have flaws. I wonder if it's the accessibility of Twitter that makes it prone to more scrutiny than the telegraph.
