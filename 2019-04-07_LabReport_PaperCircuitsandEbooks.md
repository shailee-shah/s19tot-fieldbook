#Lab Report: Paper Circuits and E-books

I don't remember who said this in class, but someone was talking about how children's books have this element of touch, feel, play to them. In those books, if they're talking about a baby chick, the chick won't just be described as soft and fluffy, the illustration will probably have literal feathers attached to it. This isn't for purely aesthetic purposes; there's the intention of added understanding (a physical representation of what it means to be soft and fluffy). As we grow older, these physical aspects of books are kind of deemed unecessary. We've been alive long enough to understand soft and fluffy, and we're able to use context clues to conceptualize unfamiliar ideas.

The circuits we were able to play with in class I think were/could be a really cool abstract representation of some ideas. The examples we were able to look at were really very beautiful. They were undeniably art. However, the purpose of those examples didn't seem like it was to actually read the books. They were altered beyond understnding. I think it would be really cool to see paper circuits intergrated into stories, both for young people and adults. 

We've spent a lot of time talking about the anxiety associated with change, and how that might explain the skeumorphs we often see in e-readers (like pages turning). I think this anxiety explains a lot of the reason that books haven't really changed forms in years. Electronic readers present up with the opportunity to really change up what we expect from books. There's chance to add a physical element to words such as movement or changing colors or flashing lights. There's a chance to kind of bring back the whimsy that children's books tend to carry. 

There's this notion of reading as a deeply intimate, deeply individual activity. The same words can be interpreted in a million different ways. Many of my English classes have been spent arguing, discussing, and evaluating the intention of different authors. I wonder if giving authors the opportunity to alter the text of their work would change these discussion. Would we still spend hours and hours discussing the meaning of their work, or would they have a newfound clarity? I think that whatever added understanding that could come from things like integrating light and video into books wouldn't change the fact that we all read things through our own perceptions. Part of the beauty of literature and of stories is how we all have our own individual and sometimes personal reactions to it. 

But beyond added understanding, I think changing up what we consider or allow to be a book would change the ways we learn and also accomodate for those that lear differently. We've spent so much time in this class discussing how books today carry this notion of academia. This idea while intriguing to some may be off-putting to others. What's the harm in adding some bells in whistles to books to help engage those that might not like to read or find it difficult? Reading I think does take an additiional level of focus as it is; unlike television or a podcast, you can't leave it playing in the background (although if you want to really understand I guess you have to pay some sort of attention). Why not begin to blur the lines between books and other media, to bring the implied attention of one to the to the other?
