# Women and the Presses

This week's readings from _The English Women's Journal_, reminded me of the cultural feminists I had to write about on my midterm today. Cultural feminists believed that men and women are fundamentally different and should be treated as such. In the _Women Compositors_, it is said that "the female mind is not mechanical" and "women, being physically weaker than men, would sooner sink under this fatigue and labour." These two generalizations emphasize what cultural feminists were talking about.However, what really drove this connection home for me was _A Ramble with Ms. Grundy_. "Never was there a trade so undeniably capable of a profitable division between women and men as this of printing," reads the article. Women were expected to compose the type, with their "flexible feminine fingers," while men were supposed to do the more heavy lifting aspects. As I read this I couldn't help but wonder about what the wage gap would be there, or if there would even be one.  

As I continued to think about this kind of unknowing cultural feminism, I found it strange how the seperation of men and women in the printing would allow jobs to open up for women. Today, it seems to be the opposite. If someone were to treat men and women as better suited for different jobs I think it would lead to a lot of missed opportunities. Another idea from this time that I think still kind of carries through is women not having mechanically-minded brains. Women continue to be minorities in "mechanical" work places (engineering). It boggles my brain to think about how decisions made hunderds of years ago continue to shape how we think about things today.
