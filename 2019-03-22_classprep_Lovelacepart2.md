# The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage Part 2

Last class, we watched several videos regarding the Jacuard Loom. In these videos, we learned about the different cards used to allow the loom to recognize the pattern it must weave. The footnote on page 162 discusses The Chinese Room thought experiment. In the Chinese room experiment, someone who doesn't speak Chinese is fed questions in Chinese and given a complete guide on how to respond to a given set of Chinese characters. It sets up this scenario to assess the  distinction between regurgitating information and producing information (how we can differentiate "between a human being understanding a communication and a computer stepping through an algorithm?") 

I think this thought experiment is a really useful tool in thinking about artificial intelligence and especially the anxiety that surrounds it. When I was thinking about this thought experiment in the context of the Jacquard loom, I couldn't really see much of a distinction in a human weaving versus the machine. In both instances, there is a recognition of a pattern, and then action carried out in order to fulfill that pattern. Perhaps, if the weaver's designs have some sort of personal meaning imbued within them, the machine would be unable to process that, but I'm not sure that really matters. This experiment reminds me of a book I read a while back called _Thinking Fast and Slow_ by Daniel Kahneman. It essentially explains a lot of human impulses as a series of yes or no questions, which I think maybe by analyzing the behavior of specific people can be predicted. This (pretty simplified) explanation of human impulse as a million little yes or no questions (a million little zeros and ones) I think is one that maybe collapses a human understanding and computer processing quite a bit.
