# The Book as Content

To me, the book has always been defined by the content that it contains. The book itself refers only to the actual form that it comes in; how books are distinguished from each other is dependant on their content. This is reflected for the most part in the ways we organize our book stores and our libraries. We don't keep our smaller books in one section and bigger books in another; we organize them by subject, usually fiction in one section and non-fiction in other.

Borsuk's discussion of the way that print revolutionized intellectual property rules really intrigued me. It highlighted how print changed the barrier of entry into what could be a book, much like ebooks are doing today. With the advent of movable type, scribes didn't need to sit for hours and painstakingly rewrite religious texts. You could now tell stories, share ideas, and express emotions in ways that might not have seemed as intuitive as before. It's almost as if a new art form was born. The copyright discussion in the Borsuk reading made me think about the ideas in the book as seperate from the physical book. For some reason, probably because I had always viewed the book as one entity, this surprised me. What is a book if not the content it contains? I found it strange that I don't think of the internet in this same way. When I was in my angsty teen years, I spent a lot of time on tumblr. I used to rip people's publically accessible html code for my theme and reblog things that fit my "brand". Looking back, I hadn't actually created any of the content, but for some reason the whole page felt like it was really mine, and if you asked me then I probably would have told you it was. It's interesting to see how the ways in which we view ownership of thoughts and ideas changes with new technologies.
