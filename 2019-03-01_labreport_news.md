# Lab #7: All the News That's Fit to Print

## What is newsworthy?

Today, when I scroll through twitter, I see news about the terrorist attacks in New Zealand, Match Day, the 2020 Presedential Election, and the Jonas Brothers. There is no limit to what can be reported on and read. In the same breath, the Boston Globe can report on the alarming spread of white supremacy throughout the globe and the giant, glowing donut off of Route 1. Modern day news organizations balance regional news with global news in their coverage. Lab #7 highlights the ways in which this was not the case in the 19th century. The news of the 19th century tended toward incredibly included. Due to the more limited availablity of resources, time, and space, news had to be selected with more intent. News couldn't spread globally in an instant as it does today.

The news that showed in the town papers in the nineteenth century at times felt incredibly personal. In the paper I looked at, there was a section that seemed to just discuss the health and well being of different community members. It had things in it like Suzy broke her arm while when she fell down, or Sally lost something. These types of articles kind of highlighted the locality of the news. Instead of reading the news these posts, coupled with personal ads, seemed more like FaceBook, which I guess makes it skeuomorphic that someone's FaceBook homepage is called their "News Feed".

There's an interesting relationship between the way that news spreads and how we value it as newsworthy that can be seen when analyzing nineteenth century news and modern news. We discussed in class the idea of the fugitive verse and of fugitive news. It's strange how even in today's age of the digital footprint, there are still some news stories that can be widely reported on, and even cause panic, that lose their author. Most recently I can think of _The Momo Challenge_ which ended up being a viral urban legend. In the nineteenth century newspaper, it becomes much more difficult to debunk "fake news," because once news becomes divorced from its reporter, there isn't any concrete form of every that that specific piece of news has existed. 

## What did news look like?

When analyzing the 19th century newspapers in class, I found it hard to focus on any particular aspect of the page, unless there were ads. Because the ads were often less text-heavy that the actual page, they helped to break up big blocks of tiny texts, and guide my eye through. The examples of newspapers I saw that hade no ads were dizzying to look at; I didn't know where I should be paying attention to. Today, when I visit a news website, like globe.com or nytimes.com, I'm annoyed by the ads. They usually pop up in the middle of an article or flash on the side of a page. They're unfortunately eye-catching. 

This evolution in advertising is something that I think is fascinating. Ads once served so many functions for a print newspaper. Not only did they generate revenue, they in a weird way just made the pages of print look nicer. Modern newpapers and new sites can't rely on ads, especially personal ads as a huge source of revnue. People can use CraigsList, message boards, and FaceBook for free. 

In some of the nineteenth-century newspapers we saw, the ads contained little stories (i.e. so and so used are product and is now incredible!). Nowadays, when you visit the website of the Globe or the New York Times, you can see stories where the byline is a company or corportion, followed by "sponsored post". This is an interesting way that modern newspapers have changed to adapt to the different way that people today want their news. People are almost hyperaware of ads, and they tend not to respond to well to them. News organizations now try to disguise their ads with in their content.
