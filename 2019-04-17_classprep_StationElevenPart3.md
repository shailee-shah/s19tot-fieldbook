#Class Prep: Station Eleven - Part 3

There were so many moments in reading this last section that left me stunned. In every book I read, I always dogear pages that make me think, and it seems like I have the last 70 pages all folded over. 

The passage with the Clarinet was of particular note to me. Her talking about the way that the upper peninsula disappears on foggy days wsas so strange, because I have a lot of summer nights that are notable for an incredibly similar experience. I'm from a suburban oasis/hellhole halfway in between Detroit and Ann Arbor,so I spent a lot of summer weekends either on Lake Michigan or up north. My favorite part about looking over Lake Michigan at night was the way that that horizon just melted away. As soon as the sun set, there stopped being a percievable distinction between the sky and water. It all turned into an eerie but calm blackness. Somehow, it always felt like there was something inexplicable out there. This isn't a particularly profound literary thought, but it just struck a chord with me. There's some things which have a beauty and a wonder and a curiousity about them that is felt across time, and there's just such a huge comfort in that for me. 

 The clarinet a lot of the same thoughts about Shakespeare and about classics as me. At the bottom of page 288, she says, "I don't think I can do better... I just think the repertoire's inadequate." She talks about how yeah, sure Shakespeare lived during the time of a plague without electricity, but Shakespeare also didn't ever know life with it. He knew the arrival of struggle, but he didn't know the magnitude of the loss of convenience in the same way that everyone post-Georgia flu did. As I was writing this discussion response, I think I kind of realized the irony of my thought process. I was so moved by the idea that some things remain beautiful, despite all the destruction that hits the world, and yet I found the fact that all the Symphony performs is Shakespeare to be insufficient. I just think that new times bring new stories to tell. 
 
Bridges to the past should exist. There's a comfort in knowing that some things remain the same over time, that history is cyclical. I just don't think this bridges to the past should be a reason to stop building monuments of the future.
