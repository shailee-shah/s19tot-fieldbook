# Lab 9: Text as Data, Data as Text

                                                                                                             
When I think about data, I often jump immediately to numbers. Data-minded people are right-brained; they prefer logic and reason to creativity and emotion, as if the two are mutually exclusive. Thinking about literary texts as data is an interesting marriage of these two ideas and helps remove the dichotomy that exists between them. Literary texts, like the works of Jane Austen, don't need the same kind of reason to exist in the same way that numerical data often does. 

I think I have always had the impulse to view data as strictly descriptive and speculative and literary work as artistic and embellished. That's not to say that literary works can't be solely descriptive and speculative, just that when they are, it's often noted as a stylistic feature of the work or a deliberate choice that the author made. Data doesn't necessarily need to be beautiful in the same way that literary work needs to be. In the comic, Lovelace describes this concept to Marian Evans as words "shedding their earthly form... liberated from the static shell of the material, transliterated to the purely symbological." When Evan's finds out that this one difference engine is the only difference engine that the data of her book can be read through, her immediate response is along the lines of "who gave you the right!?" 

This response speaks a lot to the conversations about progress that we have been having during our class discussions. What is the necessity of the difference engine, and what qualifies something as progress? This question is further complicated by the wants and needs of the consumers of new technology. Evans' response to Babbage and Lovelace made me laugh a little. She excitedly fills out the survey, asking how many decimals she can use to to answer a "on a scale from 1-10" style question. This kind of response is that antithesis of what Babbage and Lovelace are trying to do with their difference engine. It complicates the view of numbers and code as binary. 

That's why our labs using R have been so interesting. The code we have been typing is language that I on some level understand. The words that we're typing in our code make sense, and I can parse together what they mean with a little bit of context. It is a modified version of a language I already understand.  However, a lot of these words would mean something entirely different if we took them out of the R studio. The R studio allows for an environment where language (or text) is data. 


When the code of (what they think is) Evans' story is all disorganized, Babbage proposes running through Evans' other readings to form a guide pattern to reorganize this story. When reading this, I immediately thought of virtual assistants like Alexa and Siri, which (I think) through the recoginition of certain conversation patterns are able to recognize commands and conversations. Thinking about pattern recognition as a tool of literary analysis reminded me a lot of other online services that we use today, mainly Netflix.

Though Netflix isn't a literary service, the way that it sorts and recommends movies can be adopted into a form of literary analysis. Netflix has hired people to categorize every TV show and movie into incredibly specific microgenres (for example, Understate romantic road trip movies or Feel-good Mistaken-Identity romantic comedies). Based on what people have watched in the past, what they've spent time thinking about watching, what they've watched multiple times, Netflix can organize its viewers into taste groups. These taste-groups determine what recommendations pop-up on people's interfaces. In addition to this, Netflix also uses a recommendation algorithm based on artwork that choses specific cover photos to captivate certain audiences. It's not always clear what will fit what people best, however data does do all the work in improving the Netflix experience for the user. 

In this relationship, human reading (or viewing) is the catalyst for machine reading. This relationship is one that I don't really forsee changing. As a society, we have a level of agency in chosing what sort of data we would like to self-propogate. I think anxiety arises when we feel like we no longer have that agency. In terms of literary analysis, I can't help but feel like a Netflix-style algorithm may be helpful in navigating the teeming literary market that exists today. Maybe some sort of data-driven, incredibly specific, reccomendation based dewey decimal system could help readers navigate the deluge of literature that exists today.
