# Into the Meme Pool 

All I could think about while reading this week's Gleick was he notion of free will. As I was looking back through my notes to begin writing this class prep, I had literally written "humans are just puppet for the propagation of memes". When I reread that, I couldn't help but laugh at how ridiculous it sounded. However, there is some level of truth to it. I don't really know or understand why certain ideas stick really well in my head and others don't. I can't explain why I know or understand the things that I do, and I wonder about the level of agency we have in deciding what we remember and what we choose to share. 

The way that we talk about ideas and knowledge as infectious is something that I find intriguing. The way I've always seen it is not every idea is infectious. "Media indluencers" generally have to try to go viral. There's this almost formulaic development of creating a meme. I really liked the passage in Gleick that read:
	
	"A life poured into words -- apparent waste
	 intended to preserve the thing consumed"
	 
This quote is supremely meta. In writing about the human experience, in our constant desire for self-reflection and growth, are we always living one step outside of ourselves, kind of removed from the moment? As someone who values writing and reading it's strange to think about what motivates us to write about certain good or bad things that happen in our lives.
