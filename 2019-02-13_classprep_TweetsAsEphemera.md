# Tweets as Modern Day Ephemera

I struggled a bit with this week's Gitelman reading. It took me a second to think about noncodex materials, as noncodex print materials. I feel kind of like I exist in the a world that mostly codex and digital. Noncodex print materials serve very litte purpose in my life today, in fact, I'm often annoyed when people try to hand them to me around campus. The information that noncodex print materials contain is often short-lived, whether it be the day's news or infromation about an upcoming event. I would guess that this is also a part of the reason that so few noncodex print materials remain, no one really cared to save them.

Starting in my computer classes in the 6th grade, I grew up learning that everything I did digitally was permanent. An innappropriate post from high school could cost me a college acceptance; a vulgar tweet in college could cost you a job after. Different social media platforms had different connotations. Facebook was for posts for family members and old teacher, Instagram was for a carefully curated collection of photos for your peers, and Twitter was for sharing whatever you wanted. Twitter seems kind of like the noncodex prin materials of the digital age. It is for both passing thoughts, but also breaking news. It is interesting how the ephermal nature of tweets is tempered by the permenance of the digital age.
