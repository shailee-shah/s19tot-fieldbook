# Language is Culture

This week's reading in _The Information_ really made me think about my own personal dictionary. As someone who grew up in two cultures, I often come across ideas that are present in one and not in another. For example, there's no word for strawberry in Gujarati. There are strawberies in India, but the word for it them is quite literally just strawberry, but with an Indian accent. I don't exactly know the history behind how strawberries came to be in India, but I think that there's something to be said about how that word just got adopted into the language. My guess would be that strawberries came into the country during the period of British colonialization and the english word already existed so there was no need to create a unique word. Language constructs the world that we're apart of. Cultures see different things differently, and the naming of those things kind of changes the way we think about them.

In Asian-American families, it's not common to talk about mental health. A friend and I had a conversation recently where we realized that us talking about our own mental health, using tools we gathered from the American English language, was probably the first time our parents and extended families had both been able to name and define this kind of abstract concept. What's interesting is that I don't think that mental illness didn't exist in my family before me, but it had to have been called something else. Calling a depressive episode something like too tired or ungrateful really changes the way one would view and think about that concept. The reading in Gleick particularly the sections in which he discusses dictionary purists, who did not want to borrow words from other languages, really highlighted the hegemony that language can hold. By refusing to adopt words from other languages, we also refuse to accept and acknowledge their cultural ideas.
