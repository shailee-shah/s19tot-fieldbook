#The Accessibility of Texts

It makes a lot of sense to me that the fonts we use impact the way we read and think (re: Gayomali). I remember in elementary school as I was learnng to type, I wanted to use Lucida Calligraphy in every paper that I wrote. This want was (reasonably) quickly denied, and I was told that it wasn't a good academic font because it was difficult to read. I think it's interesting how, generally speaking, text on a page or on a screen is meant to be read, and yet we have so many fonts that can be just outright displeasant to read. 

Text often needs to be easily accessible. The standard fonts for things like email and search results are often some sort of Calibri. In academic writing we tend towards Times New Roman. What happens when the almost universal texts are difficult to read? Comic Sans is one of the most hated and memeified fonts around; the typeface itself seems kind of joke-ish as Gayomali mentions. Comic Sans is also one of the best fonts for those with dyslexia. I think one of the most pertinent questions of the digital age, where changing fonts is incredibly easy, is balancing stylistic decisions with inclusivity. Times New Roman creates difficulty for many dyslexic readers as it obscures the shapes of the letters with its serifs, and yet, it is what I think is primarily used in high schools and colleges. I'm not saying that everyone needs to begin using Comic Sans; however, I do think that the standard of Times New Roman should be reassessed.
