# The End of Books

The End of Books as explained by Octave Uzanne is not entirely removed from the world we live in today. I think the idea that "the man of leisure becomes daily more reluctant to undergo fatigue, that he eagerly seeks for what he calls the comfortable, that is to say for every means of sparing himself the play and the waste of the organs" is one that people still use. I most often hear this today in a derisive tone, to lament the ways in which "the youth" no longer use their brains and just mindlessly watch and listen to media. It's interesting how Uzanne doesn't view this transformation in the way that we consume books as a necessarily bad thing, more so just inevitable. He seems to be cognizant of the fact that though the physical effort and energy that go into the creation of  (though not necessarily the consumption of) these sound stories may be less than that of books, he doesnt devalue their content-meaning. 

Today, I feel like there's a certain anxiety that surrounds "the end of books." I don't really think I buy into this anxiety. Though it might seem that people are reading less Dickens and Wilde, I really do think that the general person is reading more things written from different perspectives than ever before. The internet and all the tools it brings us allows us to interact with writing more contexts than ever before. Though this reading might not occur in books, I don't think we should dismiss it as less intellectually engaging.
