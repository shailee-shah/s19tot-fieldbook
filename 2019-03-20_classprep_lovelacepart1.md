# The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage

Something that struck me pretty immediately while reading the first half of _The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage_ was the idea that math was the antithesis of poetry, that science was the antidote to art. This is very obviously closesly tied to what we have been talking about in class with the seperation of computer programming and the humanities, but it makes me wonder about the inherent seperation of the two. Why, through time, have art and science been viewed as opposite ideas? 

It's also interesting how they consistently describe Ada as poetical. Padua points out in the footnotes on page 34 that "poetical" is probably a euphemism for mental illness. This is something that I think speaks further to the seperation of art and science. Art is maddening, while science is rational and level-headed, despite the popular existence of a mad scientist figure (like Babbage). Throughout our reading for today, much is noted about how the female body is just not able to cope with expansive amounts of mathematical knowledge (page 18 for example). At the same time, there seems to be much anxiety about Ada following in her father's, the mad poet's, footsteps. Ada's womanhood definitely sets the tone for all of her work, both in the way she creates it and in the way it is percieved. I think it's really powerful to recognize that much of Ada's most important work exists in extensive footnotes for papers written by men. Though she was pushing back against the constraints placed on the women of her time, she was relegated to publishing her ideas in the margins of men's ideas.
