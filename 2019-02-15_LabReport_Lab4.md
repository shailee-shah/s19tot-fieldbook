# Lab 4: Letterpress 1: Composing the Text

## A Seperation of Type and Text

This lab helped me to understand how seperate the act of writing and composing the physical text used to be and how conjoined they are today. Even just now, as I was trying think of two distinct words for the concepts, I really couldn't come up with a phrase that didn't sound super awkward. When I use the word writing today, it refers to both creating the ideas and typing them up or writng them down. It's strange because I'm rather careless when I type. The backspace is definitly my most used key, and I frequently akdjhflhfsl out of frustration. However, when type becomes this incredibly physical thing, there isn't really any room for error. When I'm typing, it's usually not the act of typing that I find frustrating. Typing today has become second nature; my frustration tends to come from not knowing what to say. 
 
When composing _The Printer's Epitath_ this was not the case. There was no struggle in deciding what to say; I just needed to compose it. In this process, I found new points of frustration. Some of those frustrations I think would pass with time and practice, like not knowing where different letters are. Other frustrations though, I think were just a result of the nature of the work. An accidental elbow jostle normally doesn't matter at all, but when it sends the line of type you're working on into a mess, it can be frustrating. I was also frequently confusing my bs, ds, ps, and qs; my us, ns, and vs; and my ms and ws.  That's a third of the alphabet that was confusing me!

## From Monastery to Printhouse

This lab was tedious in a way that was different from our monastery stimulation. During that lab, it was slow and independent work. If my pencil point grew dull or I needed and eraser, I didn't really need anyone else to help me get it. It painted the picture of a monastery as a very independent and very quiet work environment. Monasteries seemed to be places where work was done independently and quietly. As we've discussed in class previously, part of the act of scribing for monastic scribes was gaining a better understanding of the text they were copying. Perhaps, the individual nature of scribing was well suited to further developing that relationship.

Our letterpress lab works in a much different way. The room is noisy and people are constantly getting in the way of each other. There is no heavy silence in the room, and the work seems far more collaborative. Though some of this noise can be attributed to the fact that we were working in pairs, I do think in general it is accurate to say that the environment of the printing press is far more collaborative. The purpose of composing text isn't to develop a better understanding of it; in fact, you don't really even need to know how to read to be able to do it. The activities in a printhouse seem far more physical than intellectual when compared to a monastery.

## Made with Care(lessness)?

When I think about artifacts that were produced in a monastery, it's somewhat confusing. The work of handwriting an entire text from start to finish seems to be one that would require a lot of attention and care; however, we discussed in class, there is no shortage of lamentations left in the margins and crude drawings hidden in the scribe's work. These ideas push against the idea that handwriting implies that more care was put into a piece of work, When I think about printhouse culture, when I think about the boozy band of brothers nature of it all, I can't really argue that those working in the printhouse gave a particular care about the materials they were printing. 

At the same time, as we were setting up our type, I couldn't help but be struck by the meticulousness of it all. Even though I'm aware that were some very highly skilled press operaters and compositors, it's still hard for me to imagine someone's fingers flying across a case of type in the same way that I can imagine someone's fingers flying across a keyboard.  

This lab really demonstrated the cyclical nature of print culture. In a time before the printing press, handwriting was tied to understanding. It was reserved for only those with the time to learn it. With the advent of the printing press, the physical act of producing books became more available to some (as a job); however, books for a long time were still reserved for those that could afford to pay the price for the human labor that went into it. Today, we kind of belong in this strange state, especially in education, where we are frequently told that handwriting helps you understand what you're reading better, but also there is almost no chance of walking into a Barnes and Noble and buying a handwritten book. The notion today I think is that handwriting is personal and reserved for situations that require special care. Printing is for disemminating large volumes of information to the public. My dad is a software engineer who works at a company that develops efficient printing softwares for other companies, like Random House. Though he can code the software that runs the printing for hundreds and hundreds of books, I know for a fact he probably hasn't ctually picked up an read a book since the late nineties. This is quite parallel to the idea that not every person working in a printing house needed to understand exactly what they were printing.
