# Data Reawakening 

It's interesting to think about online data being impermanent, mostly because I've always been told the opposite. Prior to reading _Data Reawakening_ I hadn't considered the ways in which data had become less traceable as it had become less physical. When I use my Google Drive account, I don't really think about the fact that on some level, my work isn't really physical, at least not in the same way that my handwritten notes are. When I think about those kinds of notes disappearing, it's a really natural process. You lose a notebook and over time the pages kind of fade or get recycled and thrown out. When things sit in my google drive semester after semester, they don't gather dust or fade away. At the same time, if I tried to find some files associated emails associated with my high school or my last co-op, I literally just can't. They've disappeared, and not in a oh I probably recycled it way, but in a I have no idea where that went way.

It's strange because there is this idea of digitally archiving things that seems both indestructible and intangible. This was another conflicting reason that I was taken aback while reading _Data Reawakening_ because it discussed the physical elements of data storage that I think I had just taken for granted. When I think about the cloud, I forget entirely that on some level it is contained within a physical boundary, which challenges how I view the internet and its accessibility.
