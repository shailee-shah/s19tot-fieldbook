# Class Prep: Station Eleven - Part 1

_Station Eleven_  immediately captured my attention with mention of _King Lear_ (a Shakespeare play I've read multiple adaptations of, but never the actual play) and an Indian name, Jeevan Chaudhary. I was intrigued because typically, Indian characters in books by non-Indian authors tend to follow very typical story arcs (sidekick nerds, convenience store owners, etc.). I was pleasantly surprised to find that Jeevan's character was pretty atypical to anyone I had read about before; I always find that the best characters are the ones that I don't know how to characterize. At first, I was struck by the fact that his hypochondriac tendencies (as hinted at by his phone call with Hua) had still led him to act in the way that he did with Arthur dying on stage, but then I realized that perhaps these tendencies were what allowed Jeevan to recognize that something was up before anyone else. These tendencies, along with the phone call from Hua are probably what allow Jeevan to survive.

Chapter 6 was a portion of the text that really stuck out to me. Mandel paints this post-apocolyptic world in a way that seems incredibly barren. Not only has humanity lost large-scale infratstructre, but also small scale comforts. As this reading progresses, this only becomes more and more evident. In a world without modern comfort, it's interesting to see how art takes on a new meaning. A lot of the members of the Symphony are referred to by their instrument, which hit me as kind of indication of how important this "job" is to their identity. The fact that the lead caravan was painted with, "because survival is insufficient" stood out to me. I thought it was interesting how the Symphony is supposed to spread art, music, and theater, yet they only perform Shakespeare plays. That seems like a method of mere survival to me. I would consider more than survival to be the production of new art, new music, new stories, not just retelling the old ones. At the same time, there is something to be said about the fact that Shakespeare stands the test of time; I suppose that gives it some sort of intrinsic value.
