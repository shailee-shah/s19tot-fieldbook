##Words

This weeks readings made me think about the way we structure our ideas. What came first, the word or writing? Can the concept/notion of the word exists without the alphabet? In Chiang's piece, we see that Jin, when being taught to write by Moseby, is confused by the spacing between the words. In what was Jin's, at the time, oral culture the concept of words doesn't exist, not because people dont use them, but just because people hadn't thought of them in that structural context. It reminded me of the "If a tree falls in the forest, but no one is around to hear it, did it still fall?" In this case the question is "If everyone uses words to share their thoughts and ideas, but no one recognizes the concept of words, do they still exist?" 

This reminded me of the passage in Gleick where he discusses the fact that language isn't necessarily a tool or technology, rather it is what the mind does. We can't think back to a time without language. He claims that the written word is the prerequisite for knowledge as we know it. It's impossible for me not to think in words. The very basis of every idea that I have is language. I grew up learning how to speak Gujarati, Hindi, and English; however, I never learned how to write in Gujarati. Frequently, my family makes fun of me, saying that that I speak Guj-eng-di, some odd amalgamation of the three languages, using Gujarati and Hindi words in an English structure. I would always be frustrated when classmates would ask me to say certain words in Gujarati because honestly, I often coudn't do it. That's not to say I wasn't near fluent in speaking; I can navigate the streets of Ahmedabad and Baroda no problem. After reading about Jin's understanding of words, I think I came to realize that because I can't think of Gujarati as letters being used to form words, I can only think of it in the ideas I want to convey.
